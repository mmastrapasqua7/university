## Asking Question

The basic rule for asking questions in English is straightforward: Invert the order of the subject and the first auxiliary verb
- "Is it snowing?" - "It is snowing"
- "Can he speak German?" - "He can speak German"
- "Have they lived here a long time?" - "They lived here a long time"
- "Will she arrive at ten o'clock?" - "She will arrive at ten o'clock"
- "Was he driving fast?" - "He was driving fast"
- "Have you been smoking?" - "You have been smoking"

If there is no auxiliary, use part of the verb **to do**
- "Do you speak fluent French?" - "You speak fluent French"
- "Does she live in Brussels?" - "She lives in Brussels"
- "Did they live in Manchester?" - "They lived in Manchester"
- "Did he have an accident?" - "He had an accident"

Most questions with question word are made in the same way
- "How often does she use it?"
- "Why don't you come?"
- "Where do you work?"
- "How many did you buy?"
- "What time did you go?"
- "Which one do you like?"
- "Whose car were you driving?"

Note **who**, **what** and **which** can be the subject. Compare:
- "Who is coming to lunch?" (Who is the subject of the verb)
- "Who do you want to invite to lunch?" (You is the subject of the verb)
- "What happened?" (What is the subject of the verb)
- "What did you do?" (You is the subject of the verb)

Note the position of the prepositions in these questions
- "Who did you speak to?"
- "What are you looking at?"
- "Where does he come from?"

In this section, we looked at how to ask direct questions. To make a question, we invert the order of the subject and the first auxiliary verb.
- "Where is Johnny?"
- "Has he found it yet?"

If there is no auxiliary, use part of the verb **to do**
- "What time did he arrive?"
- "How often do you play tennis?"

However, when we ask for information, we often say "Do you know... ?" or "Could you tell me... ?". These are indirect questions and are more polite. Note that the word order is different. For example
- "Do you know where Johnny is?"
- "Have you any idea if he has found it?"

Note that we don't use **do**, **does** or **did**. For example
- "Could you tell me what time he arrived?"
- "Would you mind telling me how often you play tennis?"

Use **if** or whatever there is no question word
- "Has he done it?" - (Do you know if he has done it?)
- "Is it ready?" - (Can you tell me if it is ready?)

These same changes in word order happen when we report questions. Note that in reported questions, the verb changes to the past:
- "What are you doing?" - (He asked me what I was doing)
- "What have you done about it?" - (He asked me what I had done about it)
- "Do you work with Pamela?" - (He asked me if I worked with Pamela)

## Question Tags

We use tags in spoken English but not in formal written English. They are not really questions but are a way of asking the other person to make a comment and so keep the conversation open.

Making a tag is very mechanical. To make a tag, use the first auxiliary. If there is no auxiliary, use **do**, **does** or **did**. With a positive sentence, make a negative tag and with a negative sentence, make a positive tag.
- "It's beautiful, isn't it?"
- "He has been, hasn't he?"
- "You can, can't you?"
- "It must be, mustn't it?"
- "You know him, don't you?"
- "He finished it, didn't he?"
- "He will come, won't he?"

- "It isn't very good, is it?"
- "It hasn't rained, has it?"
- "It can't be here, can it?"
- "Jenny doesn't know James, does she?"
- "They didn't leave, did they?"
- "He won't do it, will he?"

Notice these:
- "There isn't an ATM here, is there?"
- "Let's have a cup of coffee, shall we?"

To reply, use the same auxiliary
- "It's beautiful, isn't it?" - "Yes, it is. I think it's fabulous"
- "It isn't very good, is it?" - "No, it isn't. In fact, it's terrible"

Although, the rules are very simple and mechanical, in order to use them easily in conversations, they have to be automatic. So you need to hear and practice them very often.

## Reported Speech

We use reported speech when we are saying what other people say, think or believe
- "He says he wants it"
- "We think you are right"
- "I believe he loves her"
- "Yesterday you said you didn't like it but now you do!"
- "She told me he had asked her to marry him"
- "I told you she was ill"
- "We thought he was in Australia"

When we are reporting things in the present, future or present perfect we don't change the tense
- "He thinks he loves her"
- "I'll tell her you are coming"
- "He has said he'll do it"

When we tell people what someone has said in the past, we generally make the tense "more in the past"
- "You look very nice" = I told him he looked very nice
- "He's working in Siberia now" = She told me he was working in Siberia now
- "Polly has bought a new car" = She said Polly had bought a new car
- "Jo can't come for the weekend" = She said Jo couldn't come for the weekend
- "Paul called and left a message" = He told me Paul had called and had left me a message
- "I'll give you a hand" = He said he would give me a hand

However, when we are reporting something that was said in the past but is still true, it is not obligatory to make the tense "more in the past". The choice is up to the speaker. For example
- "The train doesn't stop here"
	- "He said the train doesn't stop here"
	- "He said the train didn't stop here"
- "I like Sarah"
	- "She said she likes Sarah"
	- "She said she liked Sarah"

When we are reporting what was said, we sometimes have to change other words in the sentence.

We have to change the pronoun if we are reporting what someone else said. Compare these two sentences. In each case the person actually said "I don't want to go"
- "I said I didn't want to go"
- "Bill said he didn't want to go"

We have to change words referring to "here and now" if we are reporting what was said in a different place or time.
Compare these two sentences. In each case the person actually said "I'll be there at ten tomorrow"
- "(If it is later the same day) He said he would be there at ten tomorrow"
- "(If it is the next day) He said he would be there at ten today"

Now compare these two sentences
- "(If we are in a different place) He said he would be there tomorrow at ten"
- "(If we are in the place he is coming to) He said he would be here at ten tomorrow"

We also use reported speech when we are saying what other people asked or wanted to know. We do not use **do** or question marks in indirect questions
- "What time is it?" = He asked me what time it was
- "Why hasn't he come?" = She wondered why he hadn't come
- "When will you be arriving?" = He wanted to know when we would be arriving
- "What were you doing?" = They questioned him about what he had been doing

We use the same structure when we report answers
- "147 Oak Street" = I told him what my address was
- "I didn't have time to do it" = She explained why she hadn't done it
- "Look at this dress and bag" = She showed me what she had bought
- "Put the paper here and press this button" = He demonstrated how the scanner worked

Yes/no questions are reported with if or whether
- "Do you want a ride?" = Mike asked me if I wanted a ride
- "Are you coming?" = They wanted to know if I was coming
- "Will you be here later?" = She asked me whether I would be here later

## Suppose

We often use **suppose** to mean **imagine** or guess
- "I suppose you'll be meeting Danielle when you go to Paris?"
- "When you weren't there, I supposed you must have held up"
- "I suppose you two know each other?"

Notice that **suppose** is not normally used in the continuous form. We do not usually say "I'm supposing"
- "Now I suppose we'll have to do something else"
- "We're waiting for John and I suppose he must be stuck in the traffic"
- "At this moment I suppose it doesn't matter"

Notice that for **imagine not** or **guess not** that we make **suppose** negative, not the other verb
- "I don't suppose you know where Mary is?"
- "I don't suppose he'll do anything"
- "I don't suppose you have a Nokia phone charger here?"

When responding to an idea with **suppose**, you can use **so** to avoid repeating the idea that has already been expressed
- "Is Susan coming to this meeting?" - I suppose so

"Suppose to be" can be used to mean "it is said/believed"
- "The new James Bond movie is supposed to be excellent"
- "He is supposed to have been rude to Mark but I don't believe it"
- "It is supposed to be the best restaurant in town"

"Supposed to be" can also be used to talk about what is arranged, intended or expected. It is a bit like **should**
- "I'm supposed to get to work by 8"
- "John is supposed to turn off all the lights when he leaves"
- "I'm supposed to pay my rent on the first of the month"
- "It's not supposed to be here"

Often there is a suggestion that the action **supposed to** happen does not actually happen
- "I'm supposed to be there before 8 but I'm often late"
- "You were supposed to phone me"
- "I'm supposed to be getting on a plane to Tokyo at this very minute"

"Not supposed to" often suggests that something is not allowed or prohibited
- "You're not supposed to smoke in here"
- "I'm not supposed to tell you"
- "We're not supposed to use the Internet for personal reasons at work"

**Suppose** can also be used as a conjunction to mean **what if**. Notice that the verb which follows it is sometimes, but not always, put "more in the past".
- "Suppose we take the earlier train to Munich? It would give us more time there"
- "Suppose we took the plane instead? That would give us even more time"
- "There's nobody in reception to let our visitors in. Suppose I sit there until somebody comes?"
- "I'm going to ask him for a pay increase" - Suppose he said **no**? What would you do?

## Have Something Done

If you "have something done", you get somebody else to do something for you
- "I'm going to have my hair cut"
- "She's having her house redecorated"
- "I'm having a copy of the report sent to you"

In informal English, we can replace **have** by **get**
- "We're getting a new telephone system installed"
- "They will be getting the system repaired as quickly as they can"
- "I got the bill sent direct to the company"

We can also use "have/got something done" in situations where something bad has happened to people or their possessions. This is not something they wanted to happen.
- "John had all his money stolen from his hotel bedroom"
- "We had our car damaged by a falling tree"
- "I got my nose broken playing rugby"

## Should Have

We can use **should have** to talk about past events that did not happen
- "I should have let her know what was happening but I forgot"

We can also use **should have** to speculate about events that may or may not have happened

- "He should have arrived at his office by now. Let's try ringing him"
- "They should have all read that first email by this stage. It's time to send the next one"

We can use "should not have" to speculate negatively about what may or may not have happened
- "She shouldn't have left work yet. I'll call her office"
- "He shouldn't have boarded his plane yet. We can probably still get hold of him"
- "They shouldn't have sent the report off for printing yet. There is still time to make changes"

We can also use "should not have" to regret past actions
- "I shouldn't have shouted at you. I apologize"
- "They shouldn't have sacked him. He was the most creative person on their team"
- "We shouldn't have left the office so late. We should have anticipated this bad traffic"

- "I could have gone to Oxford University but I preferred Harvard"

Often, there is a sense of criticism

We can use "couldn't have" to talk about something we were not capable of doing

- "They can hardly have thought that I was not interested in the job"
- "Can she have forgotten about our meeting?"

We can also use **could have** to speculate about something that didn't happen

- "You could have broken your neck, jumping out the window like that"

You can also use **could have** to talk about possible present situations that have not happened
- "He could have been Prime Minister now but he got involved in a big financial scandal"
- "They could have been the market leaders now if they had taken his advice"
- "I could have been earning a lot as an accountant but the work was just too boring"

- "They'll have been working with us for 15 years by the end of this year"
- "I'll have been working here for 35 years by the time I retire"

## For

We can sometimes use "for +ing" to talk about the purpose of a thing. When we do, it means the same as "to + infinitive"
- "This bell is for calling the waiter"
- "This bell is to call the waiter"
- "What is that for? It is for opening envelopes"

When we talk about the purpose of somebody's actions, we cannot use "for + ing"
- "You will have to queue a long time to get tickets"
- "I went there to ask for help"

However, it is sometimes possible to use "for + noun" for this
- "You will have to queue a long time for tickets"
- "I went there fro help"

We can also use "for + object + infinitive" to talk about a purpose
- "They sent a form for me to sign"
- "I gave her a notebook for her to write down new English words she found"

We can also use the pattern "for + object + infinitive" in sentences after **is** or **was**
- "The objective was for them to get the work finished by the end of last month"
- "The plan is for us to get to Barcelona by lunchtime"

We can add details to a noun by using the pattern "for + object + infinitive"
- "There is no need for you to be so aggressive"

We also use the pattern "for + object + infinitive" after certain verbs and adjectives

We can use **for** with expressions of time and distance

Sometimes we can omit the **for** completely in these expressions without changing the meaning
- "I waited a long time"

With the present perfect, **for** refers to a length of time. **Since** refers to the starting point
- "I have studied English since I was 12"

Here are some useful expressions using **for**
- "I enclose a check for 100 euros"

- "We moved to Australia and let our house in London"

A major use of **let** is for talking about allowing and permission
- "I let her leave early"

One pattern is **let** followed by an OBJECT followed by a BARE INFINITIVE
- "Why did you let Jane do that?"
- "I didn't let my friend drive my car"
- "You must let us know when you are coming to New York"
- "She let me have the last one"

Another pattern is **let** followed by an OBJECT followed by a COMPLIMENT
- "Why did you let him in?"

Notice that we can use reflexive pronouns to talk about what we allow ourselves to do
- "Did you let yourself in?"
- "I didn't let myself be talked into it"
- "She let herself out"
- "I let myself be influenced by her"

Notice that we do not make a contraction out of **let us** when asking for permission

- "Let us pay for this"
- "Let us help you"

We use "let's" when we are making a suggestion

Compare these

"Let's hope" is used to express a hope
- "Let's hope he gets the job"

## Like

We use the first conditional to talk about future events that are likely to happen. You probably know that the verb **like** can be followed by either the -ing form or by an infinitive
- "I like going to the cinema"
- "I like to see all the latest movies"

Often these two forms mean exactly the same thing but there can be a difference between them. When we use **like** to there is an idea that we think is a good idea, even if not pleasant, and it is probably a regular action.
- "I like to visit the dentist twice a year"
- "I like my children to be in bed by nine"
- "I like to keep fit"

We use **would like** to make polite offers and requests
- "Would you like to have lunch one day next week?"
- "I'd like to have your opinion"

Used as preposition, **like** often means **similar** or **typical**
- "Like me, you probably are a bit shocked by his behavior"
- "What is Harry like? Is he conceited?"
- "You look like you need to sit down"
- "I want to do something exciting - like bungee jumping"
- "It is just like him to be late"

In informal American English, **like** is used to mean **as if**. (Some people think it is **incorrect** but you will certainly hear it a lot)
- "It was like I was back in the sixties"
- "I feel like I am a princess"

Don't confuse that with feel **like** meaning "a desire to do something"
- "I feel like going out for a meal"
- "I don't feel like driving any more today"

Unusually for a proposition, **like** can have the adverbs quite or rather in front of it
- "It is rather like it was before we had computers"
- "It is quite like old times"

Here are some useful phrases using **like**
"Come when you like"
- "You are always welcome. Come when you like"

"Do as you like"

If something "sells like hot cakes", it sells really well
- "The new iphone is selling like hot cakes"

If you go "out like a light" you fall asleep immediately
- "He was so tired that he went out like a light when he lay on the sofa"

If you sleep well, you "sleep like a log"
- "I slept really well. I slept like a log"

If you "watch like a hawk", you watch really closely
