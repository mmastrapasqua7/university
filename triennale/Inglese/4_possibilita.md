## Can

We use **can** to talk about **possibility**
- "Can you do that?"
- "I can't manage to do that"
- "You can leave your car in that parking space"
- "You cannot smoke in here"

Notice that there are two negative forms: "can't" and **cannot**. These mean exactly the same thing. When we are speaking, we usually say "can't".

We use **can** to talk about ability
- "I can speak French"
- "I can't drive"

We use **can** to ask for and give permission. (We also use **may** for this but is more formal and much less common)
- "Can I speak to you or are you too busy?"
- "You can use my phone"
- "You can't come in"

We use **can** in offers, requests and instructions
- "Can I help?"
- "Can you give me a hand?"
- "When you finish that, you can take out the garbage"

We use **can** with **see**, **hear**, **feel**, **smell** and **taste** to talk about something which is happening now. (Where you would use the present continuous with most other verbs)
- "I can smell something burning"
- "Can you hear that noise?"
- "I can't see anything"

We can use "can't" for deduction. The opposite of "can't" in this context is **must**
- "You can't be hungry. You've just eaten"
- "You must be hungry. You haven't eaten anything all day"
- "He was in London one hour ago when I spoke to him. He can't be here yet"

## Could

**Could** is used to make polite requests. We can also use **can** for these but **could** is more polite
- "Could you help me, please?"
- "Could you lend me some money?"
- "Could I have a lift?"
- "Could I bother you for a moment?"

If we use **could** in reply to these requests, it suggests that we do not really want to do it. If you agree the request, it is better to say **can**.
- "Of course I can"
- "I could help you if it's really necessary but I'm really busy right now"
- "I could lend you some money but I'd need it back tomorrow without fail"
- "I could give you a lift as far as Birmingham"

**Could** is used to talk about theoretical possibility and is similar in meaning to **might**
- "It could rain later. Take and umbrella"
- "He could be there by now"
- "Could he be any happier?"
- "It could be Sarah's"

## May

We can use **may** to ask for permission. However this is rather formal and not used very often in modern spoken English.
- "May I borrow your pen?"
- "May we think about it?"
- "May I go now?"

We use **may** to suggest something is possible
- "It may rain later today"
- "I may not have time to do it today"
- "Pete may come with us"

## Might

We use **might** to suggest a small possibility of something. Often we read that **might** suggests a smaller possibility than **may**, there is in fact little difference and **might** is more usual than **may** in spoken English
- "She might be at home by now but it's not sure at all"
- "It might rain this afternoon"
- "I might not have time to go to the shops for you"
- "I might not go"

For the past, we use **might have**
- "He might have tried to call while I was out"
- "I might have dropped it in the street"

## Should

We use **should** for giving advice
- "You should speak to him about it"
- "You should see a doctor"
- "We should ask a lawyer"

We use **should** to give an opinion or a recommendation
- "He should resign now"
- "We should invest more in Asia"
- "They should do something about this terrible train service"

**should** expresses a personal opinion and is much weaker and more personal than **must** or **have to**. It is often introduced by **I think**
- "I think they should replace him"
- "I don't think they should keep the contract"
- "Do you think we should tell her?"

We can use **should** after **reporting verbs** such as **demand**, **insist**, **propose**, **recommend**, **suggest**
- "He demanded that we should pay for the repair"
- "She insisted that she should pay for the meal"
- "I have proposed that he should take charge of the organization"
- "The committee recommends that Jane should be appointed"
- "We have suggested that Michael should be given a reward for his hard work"

However, it is also possible to say exactly the same thing by omitting the **should** and just using the infinitive form without **to**. Some people call this the **subjunctive** form
- "He demanded that we pay for the repair"
- "She insisted that she pay for the meal"
- "I have proposed that he take charge of the organization"
- "The committee recommends that Jane be appointed"
- "We have suggested that Michael be given a reward for his hard work"

We can use **should** after various adjectives. Typical examples are **funny**, **interesting**, **natural**, **odd**, **strange**, **surprised**, **surprising**, **typical**
- "It's funny that you should say that. I was thinking exactly the same thing"
- "It's interesting that they should offer him the job. Not an obvious choice"
- "It's natural that you should be anxious. Nobody likes speaking in public"
- "Isn't it odd that he should be going to the same tiny hotel? What a coincidence"
- "It's strange that you should think so. Nobody else does"

We can use **should** in **if clauses** when we believe that the possibility of something happening is small
- "If you should happen to see him before I do, can you tell him that I want to speak to him urgently?"
- "If there should be a problem, just give me a call and I'll sort it out"
- "If anyone should ask where I am, say I'm in a meeting"

We can use **should** in various fixed expressions.

**To show strong agreement**
- "They're paying you compensation? I should think so"
**To express pleasure when you receive a gift**
- "What a fantastic present. You really shouldn't have"
**To emphasize a visible emotion**
- "You should have seen the look on her face when she found out that she had got the promotion"

## Must

We can use **must** to show that we are certain something is true. We are making a logical deduction based upon some clear evidence or reason
- "There's no heating on. You must be freezing"
- "You must be worried that she is so late coming home"
- "I can't remember what I did with it. I must be getting old"
- "It must be nice to live in Florida"

We also use **must** to express a strong obligation. When we use **must** this usually means that some personal circumstance makes the obligation necessary (and the speaker almost certainly agrees with the obligation)
- "I must go to bed earlier"
- "They must do something about it"
- "You must come and see us some time"
- "I must say, I don't think you were very nice to him"

We can also use **have to** to express a strong obligation. When we use **have to** this usually means that some external circumstance makes the obligation necessary
- "I have to arrive at work at 9 sharp. My boss is very strict"
- "We have to give him our answer today or lose out on the contract"
- "You have to pass your exams or the university will not accept you"
- "I have to send a report to Head Office every week"

In British English, we often use "have got to" to mean the same as **have to**
- "I've got to take this book back to the library or I'll get a fine"
- "We've go to finish now as somebody else needs this room"

We can also use "will have to" to talk about strong obligations. Like **must** this usually means that some personal circumstance makes the obligation necessary. (Remember that **will** is often used to show **willingness**)
- "I'll have to speak to him"
- "We'll have to have lunch and catch up on all the gossip"
- "They'll have to do something about it"
- "I'll have to get back to you on that"

As you can see, the differences between the present forms are sometimes very small and very subtle. However, there is a huge difference in the negative forms. We use "mustn't" to express strong obligations, NOT to do something
- "We mustn't talk about it. It's confidential"
- "I mustn't eat chocolate. It's bad for me"
- "You mustn't phone me at work. We aren't allowed personal calls"
- "They mustn't see us talking or they'll suspect something"

We use "don't have to" (or "haven't got to" in British English) to state that there is NO obligation or necessity
- "We don't have to get there on time. The boss is away today"
- "I don't have to listen to this. I'm leaving"
- "You don't have to come if you don't want to"
- "He doesn't have to sign anything if he doesn't want to at this stage"
- "I haven't got to go. Only if I want to"

## Wish

Let's start off with the easy part. "I wish to" can mean the same as "I want to" but its much, much more formal and much, much less common
- "I wish to make a complaint"
- "I wish to see the manager"

You can also use **wish** with a noun to "offer good wishes"
- "I wish you all the best in your new job"
 -"We wish you a merry Christmas"

Notice that when you want to offer good wishes using a verb, you must use **hope** and not **wish**
- "We wish you the best of luck"
- "We hope you have the best of luck"
- "I wish you a safe and pleasant journey"
- "I hope you have a safe and pleasant journey"

However, the main use of **wish** is to say that we would like things to be different from what they are, that we have regrets about the present situation
- "I wish I was rich"
- "He wishes he lived in Paris"
- "They wish they'd chosen a different leader"

Notice that the verb tense which follows **I wish** is "more in the past" than the tense corresponding to its meaning
- "I'm too fat. I wish I was thin"
- "I never get invited to parties. I wish I got invited to parties"
- "It's raining. I wish it wasn't raining"
- "I went to see the latest Star Wars film. I wish I hadn't gone"
- "I've eaten too much. I wish I hadn't eaten so much"
- "I'm going to visit her later. I wish I wasn't going to visit her later"

In the case of **will**, where **will** means **show willingness** we use **would**
- "He won't help me. I wish he would help me"
- "You're making too much noise. I wish you would be quiet"
- "You keep interrupting me. I wish you wouldn't do that"

Where **will** means a future event, we cannot use **wish** and must use **hope**
- "There's a strike tomorrow. I hope some buses will still be running"
- "I hope everything will be fine in your new job"

In more formal English, we use the subjunctive form **were** and not **was** after **wish**
- "I wish I were taller"
- "I wish it were Saturday today"
- "I wish he were here"

## Had Better

We use **had better** plus the infinitive without **to** to give advice. Although **had** is the past form of **have**, we use **had better** to give advice about the present or future
- "You'd better tell her everything"
- "I'd better get back to work"
- "We'd better meet early"

The negative form is "had better not"
- "You'd better not say anything"
- "I'd better not come"
- "We'd better not miss the start of his presentation"

We use **had better** to give advice about specific situations, not general ones. If you want to talk about general situations, you must use **should**
- "You should brush your teeth before you go to bed"
- "I shouldn't listen to negative people"
- "He should dress more appropriately for the office"

When we give advice about specific situations, it is also possible to use **should**
- "You shouldn't say anything"
- "I should get back to work"
- "We should meet early"

However, when we use **had better** there is a suggestion that if the advice is not followed, that something bad will happen
- "You'd better do what I say or else you will get into trouble"
- "I'd better get back to work or my boss will be angry with me"
- "We'd better get to the airport by five or else we may miss the flight"
