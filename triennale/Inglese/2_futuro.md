## Going To

**verbo essere + going to + present simple**

There is no one **future tense** in English. There are 4 future forms. The one which is used most often in spoken English is **going to**, **not** **will**.

We use **going to** when we want **to talk about a plan for the future**
- "I'm going to see him later today"
- "They're going to launch it next month"
- "We're going to have lunch first"
- "She's going to see what she can do"
- "I'm not going to talk for very long"

Notice that this plan does not have to be for the near future
- "When I retire I'm going to go back to Barbados to live"
- "In ten years time, I'm going to be boss of my own successful company"

We use **going to** when we want to make a prediction based on evidence we can see now
- "Look out! That cup is going to fall off"
- "Look at those black clouds. It's going to rain soon"
- "These figures are really bad. We're going to make a loss"
- "You look very tired. You're going to need to stop soon"

We can replace **going to** by **going**
- "I'm going out later"
- "She's going to the exhibition tomorrow"

## Will

**will + present simple**

Some people have been taught that **will** is the future in English. This is not correct. Sometimes when we talk about the future we cannot use **will**. Sometimes when we use **will** we are not talking about the future.

We can use **will** to talk about future events we believe to be certain
- "The sun will rise over there tomorrow morning"
- "Next year, I'll be 50"
- "That plane will be late. It always is"
- "There won't be any snow. I'm certain. It's too warm"

Often we add **perhaps**, **maybe**, **probably**, **possibly** to make the belief less certain
- "I'll probably come back later"
- "He'll possibly find out when he sees Jenny"
- "Maybe it will be OK"
- "Perhaps we'll meet again some day"

We often use **will** with **I think** or **I hope**
- "I think I'll go to bed now"
- "I think she'll do well in the job"
- "I hope you'll enjoy your stay"
- "I hope you won't make too much noise"

We use **will** at the moment we make a new decision or plan. The thought has just come into our head.
- "Bye. I'll phone you when I get there"
- "I'll answer that"
- "I'll go"
- "I won't tell him. I promise"

## Going to or Will

When we want to talk about future facts or things we believe to be true about the future, we use **will**.
- "The President will serve for four years"
- "The boss won't be very happy"
- "I'm sure you'll like her"
- "I'm certain he'll do a good job"

If we are not so certain about the future, we use **will** with expressions such as **probably**, **possibly**, **I think**, **I hope**
- "I hope you'll visit me in my home one day"
- "She'll probably be a great success"
- "I'll possibly come but I may not get back in time"
- "I think we'll get on well"

If you are making a future prediction based on evidence in the present situation, use **going to**.
- "Not a cloud in the sky. It's going to be another warm day"
- "Look at the queue. We're not going to get in for hours"
- "The traffic is terrible. We're going to miss our flight"
- "Be careful! You're going to spill your coffee"

At the moment of making a decision, use **will**. Once you have made the decision, talk about it using **going to**.
- "I'll call Jenny to let her know. Sarah, I need Jenny's number. I'm going to call her about the meeting"
- "I'll come and have a drink with you but I must let Harry know. Harry, I'm going to have a drink with Simon"

## Present forms for the Future

We use the **present continuous** to talk about things that we have already arranged to do in the future
- "I've got my ticket. I'm leaving on Thursday"
- "I'm seeing Julie at 5 and then I'm having dinner with Simon"
- "He's picking me up at the airport"
- "The company is giving everyone a bonus for Christmas"

In many situations when we talk about future plans, we can use either the **present continuous** or the **going to** future. However, when we use the present continuous, there is more of a suggestion that an arrangement has already been made.
- "I'm going to see him / I'm seeing him"
- "I'm going to do it / I'm doing it"

We use the **present simple** to talk about events in the future which are **timetabled**. We can also use the **present continuous** to talk about these.
- "My plane leaves at 6 in the morning"
- "The shop opens at 9:30"
- "The sun rises a minute earlier tomorrow"
- "My plane is leaving at 8:30"
- "The shop is closing at 7:00"
- "The sun is rising at 6:32 tomorrow"

## Will other uses

Older textbooks often refer to **will** as **the future tense** and this has confused a lot of students. It is important to remember that when we talk about the future we cannot always use **will** and that when we use **will** we are not always talking about the future.

Here **will** is clearly referring to the future
- "If I speak to her, I'll tell her about it"
- "I'll probably visit Sue when I go to Oxford"
- "Next birthday she'll be 32. Or so she says"

In these examples, however, **will** is referring to events happening at the present.
- "The car won't start"
- "If that's the phone, I'll get it"
- "Will you have another cup of coffee?"

When we use **will** referring to the present, the idea being expressed is usually one of **showing willingness** or **will power**.
- "My baby won't stop crying. I've tried everything and I'm really exhausted"
- "I am the boss. You will do as I say"
- "I need quiet to write this but he will keep on talking to me. I wish he would leave me alone"

We use **will** for requests, orders, invitations and offers.
- "Will you give me a hand?"
- "Will you please take a seat?"
- "Will you have some cake?"
- "I'll help you"

We use **will** to make promises or threats.
- "I'll do it at once"
- "I'll phone him back immediately"
- "I won't forget this"
- "I'll get my own back some day"

We use **will** for habit
- "A cat will always find a warm place to sleep"
- "My car won't go any faster than this"

We use **will** for deduction
- "I expect he'll want us to get on with it"
- "The phone's ringing. That will be Mark"

Look again at all of these example of **will**. They are all to do with the present or are **timeless**.
