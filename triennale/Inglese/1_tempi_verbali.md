**Talking about regular actions or events**

- "Ramadan doesn't start for another 3 weeks"
- "Does the class begin at 10:00 or 11:00 this week?"

**Talking about our thoughts or feelings at the time of speaking.** Although these feelings can be short-term, we use the present simple and not the present continuous
- "They don't ever agree with us"
- "I think you are right"
- "She doesn't want you to do it"
- "Do you understand what I am trying to say?"

## Present Continuous

- "It's raining"
- "Who is Kate talking to on the phone?"
- "Look, somebody is trying to steal that man's wallet"
- "I'm not looking, my eyes are closed tightly"

**Talking about action that is true at the present time but we don't it will be true in the long term**
- "I'm looking for a new apartment"

- "Are you getting enough sleep?"

**Talking about action that is at a definite point in the future and it has already been arranged**

- "They aren't arriving until Tuesday"
- "We are having a special dinner at a top restaurant for all the senior managers"
- "Isn't he coming to the dinner?"

## Present Simple or Present Continuous

We use the **present simple**

**Regular actions or events**
- "I watch TV most evenings"

**Facts**
- "The sun rises in the east"

**Facts know about the future**
- "The plane leaves at 5:00 in the morning"

**Thoughts and feelings about the same time of speaking**
- "I don't understand"

We use the **present Continuous**

**At the time of speaking (now)**
- "I'm watching a movie on TV"

**Things that are true at the moment but not always**
- "I'm looking for a new job"

**Present plans for the future**

## Past Simple

The past simple is used to talk about actions and states that we see as **completed in the past**

**Talking about a specific point in time**
- "She came back last Friday"
- "I saw her in the street"
- "They didn't agree to the deal"

**Talking about a period of time**
- "She lived in Tokyo for seven years"

We will often find the past simple used with time expressions such as there:

- three weeks ago
- last year
- in 2015
- from March to June
- for a long time
- for 6 weeks
- in the 1980s
- in the last century
- in the past

## Past continuous

**was/were + -ing**

We use the past continuous to talk about past events which went on for a period of time. We use it **when we want to emphasize the continuing process of an activity or the period of that activity**
- "While I was driving home, Peter was trying desperately to contact me"
- "Were you expecting any visitors?"
- "Sorry, were you sleeping?"
- "I was just making some coffee"
- "I was thinking about him last night"
- "In the 1990s few people were using mobile phones"

We often use it **to describe a **background action** when something else happened**
- "I was walking in the street when I suddenly fell over"
- "She was talking to me on the phone and it suddenly went dead"
- "They were still waiting for the plane when I spoke to them"
- "The company was declining rapidly before he took charge"
- "We were just talking about it before you arrived"
- "I was making a presentation in front of 500 people when the microphone stopped working"

## Past Simple or Past Continuous

Both the past simple and the past continuous refer to completed actions in the past. Most of the time when we are talking about such actions, we use the past simple. This is by far the most common way of talking about the past
- "I lived there for 6 years"
- "I only found out a few moments ago"
- "I asked her but she didn't know anything"
- "The company made 100 people redundant last year"

Only use the past continuous when you want to **emphasize the continuity of the action**
- "Everybody was talking about it all evening"
- "They were really trying hard but couldn't do it"
- "I was thinking about you the other day"
- "Were you expecting that to happen?"

When we use these two forms in the same sentence, we use the past continuous to talk about the **background action** and the past simple to talk about the **shorter completed action**
- "It was raining hard when we left the building"
- "I was reading the report when you rang"
- "He was going out to lunch when I saw him"

## Present Perfect Simple

**has/have + past participle**

We use the present perfect when we want to look back from the present to the past. We can use it **to look back on the recent past**
- "I've broken my watch so I don't know what time is it"
- "They have canceled the meeting"
- "She's taken my copy. I don't have one"
- "The sales team has doubled its turnover"

When we look back on the recent past, we often use the words **just**, **already** or **yet** (for negatives and questions only)
- "We've already talked about that"
- "She hasn't arrived yet"
- "I've just done it"
- "They've already met"
- "They don't know yet"
- "Have you spoken to him yet?"
- "Have they got back to you yet"

It can also be used **to look back on the more distant past**
- "We've been to Singapore a lot over the last few years"
- "She's done this type of project many times before"
- "We've mentioned it to them on several occasions over the last six months"
- "They've often talked about it in the past"

When we look back on the more distant past, we often use the words **ever** (in questions) and never
- "Have you ever been to Argentina?"
- "Has he ever talked to you about the problem?"
- "I've never met Jim and Sally"
- "We've never considered investing in Mexico"

## Present Perfect Continuous

**has/have + been + -ing**

This tense is used to talk about an action or **actions that started in the past and continued until recently or that continue into the future**. We can use it to refer to an action that has finished but you can still see evidence
- "Oh, the kitchen is a mess. Who has been cooking?"
- "You look tired. Have you been sleeping properly?"
- "I've got a stiff neck. I've been working too long on computer"

It can refer to an action that has not finished.
- "I've been learning Spanish for 20 years and I still don't know very much"
- "I've been waiting for him for 30 minutes and he still hasn't arrived"
- "He's been telling me about it for days. I wish he would stop"

It can refer to a series of actions
- "She's been writing to her regularly for a couple of years"
- "He's been phoning me all week for an answer"
- "The university has been sending students here for over twenty years to do work experience"

The present perfect continuous is often used with **since**, **for**, **all week**, **for days**, **lately**, **recently**, "over the last few months".
- "I've been wanting to do that for ten years"
- "You haven't been getting good results over the last few months"
- "They haven't been working all week. They're on a strike"
- "He hasn't been talking to me for weeks"
- "We've been working hard on it for ages"
- "I've been looking at other options recently"
- "He's been working here since 2001"

## Present Perfect Simple or Present Perfect Continuous

Often there is very little difference between the present perfect simple and the present perfect continuous. In many cases, both are equally acceptable.
- "They've been working here for a long time but Andy has worked here for even longer"
- "I've lived here for 10 years and she has been living here for 12 years"

To emphasize the action, we use the continuous form.
- "We've been working really hard for a couple of months"
- "She's been having a hard time"

To emphasize the result of the action, we use the simple form
- "I've made fifteen phone calls this morning"
- "He's written a very good report"

Look at the difference in these examples
- "I've been reading this book for two months but I've only read half of it. It's very difficult to read"
- "She's been trying to convince him for 20 minutes but she hasn't managed to yet"
- "They've been talking about this for month and they still haven't found a solution"

When an action is finished and you can see the results, use the continuous form.
- "The phone bill is enormous. You've been calling your boyfriend in Australia, haven't you?"
- "You're red in the face. Have you been running?"

When you use the words **ever** or **never**, use the simple form
- "I don't know them. I've never met them"
- "Have you ever heard anything so strange in your life?"

## Past Simple or Present Perfect Simple

**The past simple** is used to talk about actions in the past that have finished. It talks about **then** and definitely excludes **now**.

**The present perfect simple** to look back on actions in the past from the present. It always includes **now**.

These sentences are in the past with no connection to the present
- "I first got to know him 10 years ago"
- "I started work here in 1989"
- "I had too much to eat at lunchtime"

Same situations seen from the present
- "I've known him for 10 years"
- "I've worked here since 1987"
- "My stomach hursts. I've eaten too much"

We use time expressions like **yesterday**, **ago**, **last year**, "in 1990" with the past simple

## Past Perfect Simple

- "I checked with the supplier and they still hadn't received the contract"
- "She had already told him before I got a chance to give him my version"
