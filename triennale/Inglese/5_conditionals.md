## Zero Conditional

When we talk about things that are generally or always true, we can use

**If** / **When** / **Unless** + present form + present simple / imperative

- "If he gets there before me, ask him to wait"
- "When you fly budget airline, you have to pay for your drinks and snacks"
- "Unless you need more space, a small car is big enough for one person"

Note that we are not talking about a specific event but something which is generally true. In the condition clause, we can use a variety of present forms. In the result clause, there can only be the present simple or imperative.
- "If you visit London, go on the London Eye"
- "If unemployment is rising, people tend to stay in their present jobs"
- "If you've done that, go and have a coffee"
- "When you go on holiday, take plenty of sun cream. It'll be very hot"
- "When I'm concentrating, please don't make so much noise"
- "When I've finished an article, I always ask Kate to read it through"

Notice that **unless** means the same as **if not**
- "Unless he asks you politely, refuse to do any more work on the project"
- "Unless prices are rising, it's not a good investment"
- "Unless you've been there yourself, you don't really understand how fantastic it is"

## First Conditional

We use the First Conditional to talk about future events that are likely to happen
- "If we take John, he'll be really pleased"
- "If you give me some money, I'll pay you back tomorrow"
- "If they tell us they want it, we'll have to give it to them"
- "If Mary comes, she'll want to drive"

The **if** clause can be used with different present forms
- "If I go to New York again, I'll buy you a souvenir from the Empire State Building"
- "If he's feeling better, he'll come"
- "If she hasn't heard the bad news yet, I'll tell her"

The **future clause** can contain **going to** or the future perfect as well as **will**
- "If I see him, I'm going to tell him exactly how angry I am"
- "If we don't get the contract, we'll have wasted a lot of time and money"

The **future clause** can also contain other modal verbs such as **can** and **must**
- "If you go to New York, you must have the cheesecake in Lindy's"
- "If he comes, you can get a lift home with him"

## Second Conditional

The Second Conditional is used to talk about **impossible** situations
- "If we were in London today, we would be able to go to the concert in Hyde Park"
- "If I had millions dollars, I'd gave a lot to charity"
- "If there were no hungry people in this world, it would be a much better place"
- "If everyone had clean water to drink, there would be a lot less disease"

Note that after I/he/she/it we often use the subjunctive form **were** and not **was**. (Some people think that **were** is the only correct form but other people think **was** is equally correct)
- "If she were happy in her job, she wouldn't be looking for another one"
- "If I lived in Japan, I'd have sushi every day"
- "If they were to enter our market, we'd have big problems"

Note the form "if I were you" is often used to give advice
- "If I were you, I'd look for a new place to live"
- "If I were you, I'd go back to school and get more qualifications"

The Second Conditional is also used to talk about **unlikely** situations
- "If I went to China, I'd visit the Great Wall"
- "If I was the President, I'd reduce taxes"
- "If you were in my position, you'd understand"

Note that the choice between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker's attitude rather than of facts. Compare these examples. Otto thinks these things are possible, Peter doesn't
- Otto - "If I win the lottery, I'll buy a big house"
- Peter - "If I won the lottery, I'd buy a big house"
- Otto - "If I get promoted, I'll throw a big party"
- Peter -  "If I got promoted, I'd throw a big party"
- Otto - "If my team win the Cup, I'll buy champagne for everybody"
- Peter - "If my team won the Cup, I'd buy champagne for everybody"

Note that the **if clause** can contain the past simple or the past continuous
- "If I was still working in Brighton, I would commute by train"
- "If she were coming, she would be here by now"
- "If they were thinking of selling, I would want to buy"

Note that the main clause can contain **would**, **could** or **might**
- "If I had the chance to do it again, I would do it differently"
- "If we met up for lunch, we could go to that new restaurant"
- "If I spoke to him directly, I might be able to persuade him"

Also note that sometimes the **if clause** is implied rather than spoken
- "What would I do without you?" ("if you weren't here")
- "Where would I get one at this time of night?" ("if I wanted one")
- "He wouldn't agree" ("if I asked him")

## Third Conditional

We can use the Third Conditional to talk about **impossible** conditions, impossible because they are in the past and we cannot change what has happened
- "If I had worked harder at school, I would have got better grades"
- "If I had time, I would have gone to see him. But I didn't have time"
- "If we had bought that house, we would have had to rebuild the kitchen"
- "If we had caught the earlier train, we would have got there on time but we were late"

Notice that the main clause can contain **would**, **could** or **might**
- "If I had seen him at the meeting, I would have asked him" ("but he wasn't there so I didn't")
- "If I had seen him at the meeting, I could have asked him" ("but he wasn't there so it wasn't possible")
- "If I had seen him at the meeting, I might have asked him" ("but I'm not sure. Perhaps if the opportunity had arisen")
- "If I had paid more attention in class, I would have understood the lesson"

Also notice that sometimes the **if clause** is implied rather than spoken
- "I'd have done it" ("if you had asked me but you didn't")
- "I wouldn't have said that" ("if I'd been there")
- "He wouldn't have let him get away with that" ("if he had tried that with me")
