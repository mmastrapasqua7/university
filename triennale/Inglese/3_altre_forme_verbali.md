## Shall

We don't use **shall** very frequently in modern English, particularly in American English.

It is used to make offers and suggestions and to ask for advice
- "What time shall we meet?"
- "Shall we vote on it now?"
- "What dress shall I wear?"
- "Shall I open the window?"

You only really need to know that about **shall** in modern English. Read the rest of this only if you want to know more about how some older speakers still use **shall**.

Formerly, in older grammar, **shall** was used as an alternative to **will** with **I** and **we**. Today, **will** is normally used. When we do use **shell**, it has an idea of a more personal, subjective future
- "I shall go to see the boss and I shall ask him to explain this decision"

## Imperative

We can use the imperative to give a direct order
- "Take that chewing gum out of your mouth"
- "Stand up straight"
- "Give me the details"

We can use the imperative to give instructions
- "Open your book"
- "Take two tablets every evening"
- "Take a left and then a right"

We can use the imperative to make an invitation
- "Come in and sit down. Make yourself at home"
- "Please start without me. I'll be there shortly"
- "Have a piece of this cake. It's delicious"

We can use the imperative on signs and notices
- **Push**
- "Do not use"
- "Insert one dollar"

We can use the imperative to give friendly informal advice
- "Speak to him. Tell him how you feel"
- "Have a quiet word with her about it"
- "Don't go. Stay at home and rest up. Get some sleep and recover"

We can make the imperative **more polite** by adding **do**
- "Do be quiet"
- **Do come**
- "Do sit down"

## Passive

We use the active form to say what the subject does
- "I speak English every day at work"
- "I repaired the flat tire on the car"

We use the passive form to say what happens to people and things, to say what is done to them
- "English is spoken here"
- "The car is being repaired"

We use the passive form when we don't know who did the action
- "The car was damaged while it was parked on the street".
- "The shirts were made in Turkey"

We use the passive form when what was done is more important than who did it
- "It was approved by Gerry last week"
- "I was informed by the Human Resources Manager only two days ago"

## -ING Form

The **-ing** form can be used like a noun, like an adjective or like a verb
- "Smoking is forbidden"
- "I have a long working day"
- "I don't like dancing"

When it is used like a noun it may or may not have an article before it
- "Marketing is a very inexact science"
- "The marketing of the product will continue for a few months yet"

It can also be part of a **noun phrase**
- "Speaking to an audience is always stressful"
- "Swimming after work is very relaxing"

In formal English, we would use a possessive with the **-ing** form. In informal English, many people do not
- "I'm angry about his missing the meeting"
- "Do you mind my coming?"

As and adjective, the **-ing** form can be used before a noun
- "I was met by a welcoming party at the airport"
- "Let's go to the meeting room"

The **-ing** form is used after prepositions
- "Before leaving, you need to speak Sarah"
- "After discussing it with her, I've changed my mind"
- "Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do some work for charity"

Notice that when **to** is used as a preposition, it is followed by the **-ing** form
- "I don't object to working this Sunday"
- "I'm looking forward to seeing him again"
- "I'm used to working long hours"

There are man verb + **-ing** combinations
- "I admit telling her"
- "I appreciate having the raise"
- "I avoid speaking to him"
- "I consider blowing your nose in public to be wrong"
- "I delayed coming until the last possible moment"
- "He denied telling her"
- "I detest going to parties"
- "I enjoy dancing"
- "I feel like having a party"
- "I've finished writing the report"
- "I've given up going to the gym"
- "I can't help thinking about it"
- "I can't imagine ever leaving this company"
- "I don't mind doing that"
- "He put off talking to her as long as he could"
- "I can't stand drinking beer"

Some verbs can be followed by either the infinitive or **-ing** form but with different meanings
- "I stopped smoking last month" (I no longer smoke)
- "I stopped to smoke a cigarette" (I stopped what I was doing and had a cigarette)
- "I remember telling him" (A memory of the past)
- "I must remember to tell him" (Something to remember for the future)
- "I'm interested in finding out more details" (Interested about the future)
- "I was interested to read his report" (Interested in the past)

Some verbs can be followed by either the infinitive or **-ing** form but with the same meaning
- "I love to go shopping"
- "I love going shopping"
- "I'm afraid to fly"
- "I'm afraid of flying"
- "I started to learn English 5 years ago"
- "I started learning English 5 years ago"

## Used to

We use **used to** for something that happened regularly in the past but no longer happens
- "I used to smoke a packet a day but I stopped two years ago"
- "Ben used to travel a lot in his job but now, since his promotion, he doesn't"
- "I used to drive to work but now I take the bus"

We also use it for something that was true but no longer is
- "There used to be a cinema in the town but now there isn't"
- "She used to have really long hair but she's had it all cut off"
- "I didn't use to like him but now I do"

"Used to do" is different from "to be used to doing" and "to get used to doing".

We use "to be used to doing" to say that something is normal, not unusual
- "I'm used to living in my own. I've done it for quite a long time"
- "Hans has lived in England for over a year ago so he is used to driving on the left now"
- "They've always lived in hot countries so they aren't used to the cold weather here"

We use "to get used to doing" to talk about the process of something becoming normal for us
- "I didn't understand the accent when I first moved here but I quickly got used to it"
- "She has started working nights and is still getting used to sleeping during the day"
- "I have always lived in the country but now I'm beginning to get used to living in the city"
